// You can use packages for the better coding. Here all the code is written without package
/**
 * One Java file has only one high level public class. But it can have any number of classes
 * The name of the top level public class must be same as the file name
 * .class file such as Main.class is called bypte code. Compiler creates the byte code for each class in your codebase
 * 
 * static in method definition indicates that it is a class method and you can call that method without
 * instantiating its class
 */

//  Variables
/**
 * start with underscore, lowercase, and camelCase, case sensitive
 * 
 * CONST in java = static final(eg; static final int age ) => static final = phrase
 *      final keyword means once value is assigned it can never be changed (final int age = 27)

//  Q1. create a class and declare method in it to be static, and call that method in top-level class


public class Basics{

    // static keyword means that you can call main method without instantiating its class.
    public static void main(String []args){

        // Basic syntax
        System.out.println("Hellow Developers out there!!!");
        System.out.println("This is Nabin getting ready for full stack java development");
    }
